Hi! My name is Nick.

I'm currently building a custom worldwide network in Linux XDP at [emnify](https://www.emnify.com).

I will write predominately about ebpf topics for a while. Ebpf is not exactly new in 2023/24. Despite that, it still feels like a frontier, the technological Wild Wild West. Thanks to the amazing community out there, it has been partially civilized. Yet, there are so much more great things left to build.

Facing problems no one has yet found good solutions for is so immensely fulfilling. At emnify, we are building a global network as an application. It has to be robust, it has to be fast, and it has to scale, while remaining economical to operate. We aim for continuous delivery, a challenge since some components are stateful.

Did I mention fast? This is another itch I love to scratch. I feel passionate about low level languages, multi-threading, compiler internals, and all things performance-related.
